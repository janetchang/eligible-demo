## Eligible Demo

1. Clone this repository 
2. `cd eligible-demo`
2. `bundle install`
3. `rails s`
4. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Usage

From the dashboard, enter your API key from Eligible and NPI information. You can then add patients and perform eligibility checks.

### Demo

There is also a read-only live demo [available here](TBD).
